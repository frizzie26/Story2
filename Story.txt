I woke up 
I brushed my teeth 
I got dressed 
I came to school
I finished homework form the day before
I ate breakfast
I went to all my classes
Went to boxing class
Then finally got home 
I did all my homework and went to sleep
Then repeated it all over again
This summer i plan on working 
getting some sleep in 
and also going out with freinds and having fun
Also eating alot of ice cream
I want to also go to the beach
I love to swim and dance
